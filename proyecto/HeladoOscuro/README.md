In this program we translate sets of instructions similar to the MIPS
architecture to binary code using a Python based script 

In order to execute our program, you must open a new terminal and type:
	python3 main.py

Then it will request you to input the filename containing the sets of
instructions you want to translate

The output binary codes will be stored in a file called 'output.txt'

This project was worked in the following repo:
